# spell_checker
---
This is a program for checking spellings in a paragraph and correct the mistakes.
The program is only 75% completed, the rest 25% is the word suggestion for the incorrect spelling, which I couldn't code.
The detailed work description is mentioned in the pdf provided.
Note: All the files needed to be stored in the same location to avoid file read path error while execution of the code.
